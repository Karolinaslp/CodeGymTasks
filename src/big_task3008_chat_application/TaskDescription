Plan to write a chat system.
The system will consist of one server and multiple clients,
one for each chat participant.

PART 1: Work with ConsoleHelper class

    1. Add BufferedReader field and initialized it.
    2. Create writeMassage(),
              readString(),
              readInt() methods and  implement them.
    3. Add values for the MessageType enum.
    4. Implement Message class.

PART 2: Working with Connection class

    1. Add Socket, ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream fields.
    2. Acknowledge about socket connection.
    3. Make Connection class serializable.
    4. Create send(),
              receive(),
              getRemoteSocketAddress(),
              close() methods and implement them.
    5. Implement Closeable interface.
    6. Add synchronized block in send() and receive() methods.

PART 3: Working with Server class

    1. Create nested private Handler class that inherits Thread.
    2. Implement Handler class.
    3. In main method create a server socket connection.
    4. In while look server waits for client to connect to the socket
       and creates a new Handler thread on which message will be exchanged.
    5. Add static Map field which contain clients names as key, and connection as value.
    6. Create and implement sendBroadcastMessage() method.
    7. In Handler nested class add serverHandshake() method that:
             a) Generate and send a username request
             b) Get the client's response
             c) Verify that the response has a username
             d) Extract the name from the response, and verify that it is not empty and is not already being used (use connectionMap)
             e) Add the new user and connection to connectionMap
             f) Send an informational message to the client, informing it that the name was accepted
             g) If any verification step fails, request the client's name again
             h) Return the accepted name as the return value
