From working on this mini project I learned:
    1. How to create application with a graphic interface.
    2. How to wor with dialog boxes.
    3. How to use classes from the Swing library.
    4. How to implement interaction between program components with help of events, listeners and actions.
    5. How to implement MVC pattern in the project.

 Work in progress...

 More to do:
    1. Add a toolbar that replicates the functionality of the menu.
    2. Add highlighting of HTML tags on the second tab.
    3. Add the ability to load a document from the internet.
    4. Expand the editor's capabilities:
            - insert images
            - links
