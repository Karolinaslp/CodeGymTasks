RESTAURANT MANAGER

Program to automate what happens in a restaurant.
    1) each table has a tablet that can be used to place orders;
    2) while an order is being prepared, the tablet shows ads;
    3) at the end of the business day, various statistics can be reviewed:
    a) cook utilization;
    b) total revenue from orders;
    c) total revenue from ad impressions.

I'm going to implement:
First:
- Customer orders will be sent to the cook automatically;
- The cook will prepare an order for a while and then mark it as prepared;
- Then the waiter will carry it away.

Second:
- Select the desired commercials from a list of paid ads;
- Display commercials while the order is being prepared;
- Maximize the ad revenue.

Third:
- Calculate the statistics;
- Display the statistics to the manager.
