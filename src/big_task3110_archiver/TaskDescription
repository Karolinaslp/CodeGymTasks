I plan to write an archiver that will be able to zip and unzip files.

PART 1:

    1. Create ZipFileManager class : It will perform operations on the archive file.
    2. Create Archiver class and add main method to it.
    3. Implement createZip() method that zip the file specified by the source argument.
