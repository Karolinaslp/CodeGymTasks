I plan to write an archiver that will be able to:
 a) zip and unzip files.
 b) extract an archive.
 c) add a new file to an existing archive.
 d) remove a file from an archive.
 e) view the contents of an archive.

PART 1:

    1. Create ZipFileManager class : It will perform operations on the archive file.
    2. Create Archiver class and add main method to it.
    3. Implement createZip() method that zip the file specified by the source argument.

PART 2:

   1. Declare the Operation enum, and add the commands to it.
   2. Create and implement ConsoleHelper class:
        a) add void writeMessage(String message) method that writes message to the console.
        b) add String readString() method tha tread string from the console.
        c) add int readInt() method that read number from the console.

PART 3:

    1. Create command package that will store commands which implies the execution of some action.
    2. Create class for each command.
    3. Create Command interface with execute() method which use ConsoleHelper class to display message.

PART 4:

    1. Create CommandExecutor class that implements command pattern.
    2. Prevent direct calls to the constructor by making it private.
    3. Create allKnownCommandsMap that store the commands.
    4. Create execute(Operation operation)  method which select the required command from map, and calls its execute method.
